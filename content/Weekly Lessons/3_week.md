Tags: Week 3, Excercises, LeetCode


### Goals

- Practice time and space complexity analysis
- Get comfortable with problem identification
- Review linked lists, hash table, stacks, queues, heaps problems



## Wednesday

* [Trapping Rain Water II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/description/)
* [Largest Rectangle in Histogram - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/)


* [Smallest Range I - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-i/)



## Thursday


* [Sort Characters By Frequency - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/description/)
* [Daily Temperatures - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/description/)
* [4Sum - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/description/)



Read time complexity articles:

* [Big O Complexity Analysis Â· codepath/compsci_guides Wiki](https://github.com/codepath/compsci_guides/wiki/Big-O-Complexity-Analysis)
* [Big O Notation | Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/java/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity)
* [Logarithms for algorithmic coding interviews | Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/java/logarithms)





## Saturday

Work through the time complexity problems from [Interview Bit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/time-complexity/). Do as many problems as you can in these sections:

- basic primer
- math
- compare functions



After that, we will work through the following problems using UMPIRE

* [Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/description/)
* [Trapping Rain Water - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)

**Talk through problems** - Select one person to code  the solution and rotate for the next question. The other person should  work with the coder to come up with a solution. This isn't just about  getting a correct solution but also effective communication.

- Come up with a few new example input/ outputs
- Talk about the edge cases
- Talk about different approaches
- Pseudocode
- Code the solution (talk throughout this segment!)
- Test your solution
- After completing a problem, scroll down to the bottom of this tab to  find the solution links and discuss/compare your solution with the  solution given. Is the one you've developed less efficient or less  concise? Repeat this and work through the exercises below.
