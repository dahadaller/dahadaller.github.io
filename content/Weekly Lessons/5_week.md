Tags: Week 5, Excercises, LeetCode

## Goals

- Understand various graph representations
- Recognize problems that can be solved with graphs
- Know how to quickly implement graph searches (BFS, DFS)
- Recognize topological sort graph problems

Keep in mind that during interviews coding questions are usually allotted 30-40 minutes. Given that time constraint, you should aim to spend around 15-20 minutes on each problem. So, figure out how to work through a particular class of problems, and then revisit them later on to cut down the time you spend on each problem.

## Tuesday
Read the following articles and watch the youtube playlist that walks through graph problems.
* [Graphs · codepath/compsci_guides Wiki](https://github.com/codepath/compsci_guides/wiki/Graphs)
* [Graph Traversals · codepath/compsci_guides Wiki](https://github.com/codepath/compsci_guides/wiki/Graph-Traversals)
* [Topological Sort · codepath/compsci_guides Wiki](https://github.com/codepath/compsci_guides/wiki/Topological-Sort)
* [Detect Cycle in Directed Graph - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7zKQzeqjecKpXlM9hd_jA-9PZ6EZGzd0)

## Wednesday
