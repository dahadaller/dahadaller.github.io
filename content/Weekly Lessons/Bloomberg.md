2. [Two City Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/description/)
3. Electronic Exchange.

    > You work in an electronic exchange. Throughout the day, you receive ticks (trading data) which consists of  product name and its traded volume of stocks. Eg: {name: vodafone, volume: 20}. What data structure will you 
    > maintain if:
    >
    > * You have to tell top k products traded by volume at end of day.
    > * You have to tell top k products traded by volume throughout the day.

4. Insert Delete GetRandom o(1)

    > Design a data structure with requirements:
    > You have a <Key, Value> structured input data for all objects
    > Where you have
    > Insert : O(1)
    > Lookup : O(1)
    > Delete : O(1)
    > You can traverse the added elements in the order they were inserted.

    > s = "()(()()()()())"
    > Remove the minimum amount of parentheses to make the string parentheses balanced in-place

7. [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)





### Wednesday

8. [Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

9. [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

10. [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/) Optimize from O(N) to O(log N) time complexity.

11. [Flatten a multilevel doubly linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/)

11. [Output data from a stream in order](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/314733/Bloomberg-or-Output-data-from-a-stream-in-order)

    > Input: (1, "abcd"), (2, "efgh"), (4, "mnop"), (5, "qrst"), (3, "ijkl")
    >
    > Write a program to output the data from the stream in realtime in order, so 1,2,3,4,5..
    > You cannot queue up the incoming data from the stream.
    > So for example if the first incoming bit of data is (1, "abcd"), and the second is (4, "mnop"), you cannot output (4, "mnop") until you get 2, 3.
    
13. [Find the minimum steps to generate a number given only two operations (BFS)](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/406663/Bloomberg-or-Phone-Screen-or-Min-Steps-to-Generate-Number)

14. https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/329221/Bloomberg-or-Phone-screen-or-Software-Development-Internship-2019

15. [Reorder array based on dictionary](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/413734/Bloomberg-or-Re-order-Array-Based-on-Dictionary)
      Similar to [Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/)
    
### Saturday

16. [Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/)

17. [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

18. [Longest Substring without repeating characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

17. [Flatten Linked List or First Unique Element](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/341369/Bloomberg-or-Phone-screen-or-First-unique-element-and-Flatten-linked-list)

20. [ File Diffs with RAM Constraints ](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/346748/Bloomberg-or-Phone-Screen-or-File-Diffs-With-Ram-Constraints)

18.  [Remove array elements in given index ranges](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/407179/Bloomberg-or-Remove-array-elements-in-given-index-ranges)

22.  Right side view and Word Search: This is the question I (the author) got on my phone interview today. Nov 10 2019. I got 2 Leetcode medium questions with 5 minutes for questions and 5 minute for introductions, leaving 35 minutes for the coding  portion. We discussed my past experience and he probled in deeper to see if I did have a good understanding of the tech stack that was used by  my previous internship.
    - LC Medium: [Right side view of a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)
      They expected this code to compile and be tested out to be completely bug free, so you need to write the test cases yourself.
    -  LC Medium: [Word Search I](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)
      The interviewer did not expect this code to compile, so long as the  general idea is correct you are good. You are expected to manually run  through your code using their example.
